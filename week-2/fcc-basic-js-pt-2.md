```js
function chainToSwitch(val) {
  var answer = "";
  // Only change code below this line
  
  switch(chainToSwitch) {
    case "bob":
      answer = "Marley";
      break;
    case 42:
      answer = "The Answer";
      break;
    case 1:
      answer = "There is no #1";
      break;
    case 99:
      answer = "Missed me by this much!";
      break;
    case 7:
      answer = "Ate Nine";
      break;
    default:
      answer = "";
  }
  
  // Only change code above this line  
  return answer;  
}

// Change this value to test
chainToSwitch(99);
