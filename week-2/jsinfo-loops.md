## 1.Last loop value
```js
let i = 3;

while (i) {
  alert( i-- );
}

The answer: 1 Because every loop iteration decreases i by 1. The check while(i) stops the loop when i = 0.
```
## 2.Which values does the while loop show?
```js
-The prefix form ++i:

let i = 0;
while (++i < 5) alert( i );                       
                                                      
alert( 1 ) 

The answer:

-The postfix form i++:

let i = 0;
while (i++ < 5) alert( i );
