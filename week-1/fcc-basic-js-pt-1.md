## 1. Comment Your Code
```js
// for one line comments //
/* for multiple
line comments */ 
```

## 2. Declare Variables
```js
var myName; 
>> value of myName is undefined
```
## 3. Storing Values with the Assignment Operator

```js
a = 7;
b = a;
```
## 4. Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator
```js
var a=9;
```
## 5. Understanding Uninitialized Variables
```js
a =5;
b=10;
c="I am a";
Result:
a=6 b=15 c=I am a String!
```
## 6. Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables
```js
// Declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;

if the dec and asg do not match, then both will be regarded as two different vars. 
```

## 7. Add Two Numbers with JavaScript
```js
var sum = 10 + 10;
```

## 8. Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScript
```js
var difference = 45 - 33;
```
## 9. Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript
```js
var product = 8 * 10;
```

## 10. Divide One Number by Another with JavaScript
```js
var quotient = 66 / 33;
if the division is not a whole, also gives out results with decimals
```

## 11. Increment a Number with JavaScript
```js
myVar++;
```

## 12. Decrement a Number with JavaScript
```js
myVar --;
```

## 13. Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScript
```js
var myDecimal = 2.5;
```

## 14. Multiply Two Decimals with JavaScript
```js
var product = 2.0 * 2.5;
```
## 15. Divide One Decimal by Another with JavaScript
```js
var quotient = 4.4 / 2.0;
```
## 16. Finding a Remainder in JavaScript
```js
var remainder;
remainder = 11 % 3;
remainder is assigned 2
```

## 17. Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition
```js
a+=12;
b+=9;
c+= 7;

console.log(a,b,c); 15, 26, 19
```
## 18. Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction
```js
a -= 6;
b -= 15;
c -= 1;

console.log(a,b,c); 5,-6,2
```
## 19. Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication
```js
a *= 5;
b *= 3;
c *= 10;
```
## 20. Compound Assignment With Augmented Division
```js
a /= 12;
b /= 4;
c /= 11;
```
## 21. Declare String Variables
```js
var myFirstName = "saliha"
var myLastName = "yaylaci"
```
## 22. Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings
```js
myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\"."
```
## 23.Quoting Strings with Single Quotes
```js
var myStr = '<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">Link</a>';
```
## 24. Escape Sequences in Strings
```js
var myStr = "FirstLine\n\t\\SecondLine\nThirdLine"
\'	single quote
\"	double quote
\\	backslash
\n	newline
\r	carriage return
\t	tab
\b	backspace
\f	form feed
```
## 25. Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator
```js
myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end.";
console.log(myStr); == This is the start. This is the end.
```
## 26. Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator
```js
var myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr += "This is the second sentence.";
console.log(myStr); == This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence.
```
## 27. Constructing Strings with Variables
```js
var myName = "saliha"
var myStr = "I am " + myName + "!"
console.log(myStr); == I am saliha!
```
## 28. Appending Variables to Strings
```js
var someAdjective = "makkelijk"
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr+=someAdjective;
console.log(myStr); == Learning to code is makkelijk
```
## 29. Find the Length of a String
```js
lastNameLength = lastName.length;
```
## 30. Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String
```js
Zero-based indexing.
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0]; -> gets the first letter
```
## 31. Understand String Immutability
```js
myStr = "Hello World";
```
## 32. Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String
```js
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];
```
## 33. Use Bracket Notation to Find the Last Character in a String
```js
var lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 1];
```
## 34. Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a String
```js
var secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 2];
```
## 35. Word Blanks
```js
var result =  myAdjective + " " + myNoun + " " + myVerb + " " + myAdverb;
var str = wordBlanks("dog", "big", "ran", "quickly");
console.log(str) == big dog ran quickly
