/*This is a possibly multiline
comment.*/
```

```

## 5. Understanding Uninitialized Variables

```js

// Do not change code below this line

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";
```

## 6. Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables

```

## 13. Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScript

```js
var myDecimal=8.7;
```

## 14. Multiply Two Decimals with JavaScript

```js
var product = 2.0 * 2.5;
```

## 15. Divide One Decimal by Another with JavaScript

```js
var quotient = 4.4 / 2.0;
```

## 16. Finding a Remainder in JavaScript

```js
var remainder = 11 % 3;
// remainder is equal to 2
```

## 17. Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition

```js
var a = 3;
var b = 17;
var c = 12;

// Only modify code below this line

a += 12;
b += 9;
c += 7;

// a is equal 15
// b is equal 26
// c is equal 19

```

## 18. Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction

```js
a -= 6;
b -= 15;
c -= 1;
```

## 19. Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication

```js
a *= 5;
b *= 3;
c *= 10;
```

## 20. Compound Assignment With Augmented Division

```js
var a = 48;
var b = 108;
var c = 33;

// Only modify code below this line

a /= 12;
b /= 4;
c /= 11;
```

## 21. Declare String Variables

```js
var myFirstName = "prgrm";
var myLastName = "fl";
```

## 22. Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings

```js
var myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\".";
// output is: I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes".
```

## 23. Quoting Strings with Single Quotes

```js
var myStr = '<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">Link</a>';
```

## 24. Escape Sequences in Strings

```js
var myStr = "FirstLine\n\t\\SecondLine\nThirdLine";

// FirstLine
//    \SecondLine
// ThirdLine
```

## 25. Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator

```js
var myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end.";
```

## 26. Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator

```js
var myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr += "This is the second sentence.";
```

## 27. Constructing Strings with Variables

```js
var myName = "prgrmfl";
var myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am well!";
```

## 28. Appending Variables to Strings

```js
var someAdjective = "enjoying";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;
```

## 29. Find the Length of a String

```js
// Setup
var lastNameLength = 0;
var lastName = "Lovelace";

lastNameLength = lastName.length;
//8
```

## 30. Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String

```js
var firstLetterOfLastName = "";
var lastName = "Lovelace";

firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0];
```

## 31. Understand String Immutability

```js
var myStr = "Jello World";

myStr = "Hello World";
```
## Comment: 
The individual characters of a string literal cannot be changed. The only way to change myStr would be to assign it with a new string.
-This (myStr[0] = "H") doesn't work.

## 32. Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String

```js
var lastName = "Lovelace";

var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];
```

## 33. Use Bracket Notation to Find the Last Character in a String

```js
var lastName = "Lovelace";

var lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 1];
```

## 34. Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a String

```js
var lastName = "Lovelace";

var secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 2];
```

## 35. Word Blanks

```js
function wordBlanks(myNoun, myAdjective, myVerb, myAdverb) {
  var result = "If I had a " + myAdjective + " " + myNoun + ", crazy people would have " + myVerb + " it " + myAdverb + "!";
  return result;
}

wordBlanks("hummer", "fancy", "adore", "much");
```
